#' dailies: A package for working with the RStudio daily build pages.
#'
#' RStudio offer their daily builds of the IDE to the community so that we can
#' help out with bug reports and check out new features before they hit the
#' stable releases. The RStudio dailies website is available at
#' \url{https://dailies.rstudio.com}
#'
#' The dailies package provides several functions for working with the dailies
#' page itself and is intended to make it easier for people to get useful URLs
#' from within R.
#'
#' @section Important Note: Some functions request data from the RStudio
#'   website. Please be respectful in your usage of these functions. The dailies
#'   site is offered as a service to the community and we should not repay that
#'   kindness by hammering the site.\cr This package is very much "unofficial".
#'
#' @section dailies functions: The most useful function is
#'   \code{latest()} which returns the url for the latest version.
